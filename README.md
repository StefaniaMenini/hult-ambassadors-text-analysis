Academic project (individual) for "Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing", a curricular course attended throughout the fall semester of my second master's degree in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School. The biographies and the interests of the showcased Hult studentsâ€™ ambassadors have been properly analyzed to detect any bias across campuses, topics, or other observed information. After having showcased similarities and differences between the Eurasia and America campuses, three marketing recommendations have been given to guarantee a welcoming, diverse, and inclusive learning atmosphere. This project helped me to improve my skills in the following areas:

- Text mining 
- String Manipulation 
- Corpus Definition 
- Term Frequency Analysis
- Term Association Analysis 
- Word Clouds Creation
